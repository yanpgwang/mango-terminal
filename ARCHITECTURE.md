# Architecture

Mango Terminal is intentionally a remote client, not another Agent runtime.
It has three layers.

```text
managed-agent-go HTTP + SSE
            │
            ▼
 internal/mango     protocol, attach, history, streams, actions
            │
            ▼
 internal/feed      deterministic ledger → conversation projection
            │
            ▼
 internal/ui        cloud-window state, dialogs, and responsive rendering
```

## Protocol boundary

`internal/mango` owns the wire shapes and header contract. Attaching follows
the server's gap-free recommendation:

1. fetch the Session and Thread roster;
2. open an SSE subscription for every Thread;
3. after all response headers are open, list each durable ledger;
4. merge by persisted event ID.

The stream is not assumed to replay. Reconnection performs a new attach with
bounded exponential backoff. A `session.thread_created` event triggers roster
discovery and reattachment; Mango does not poll every Session continuously.
All per-Thread subscriptions form one aggregate: if any child stream ends,
the siblings are canceled so the complete roster is reattached rather than
silently leaving one Agent stale.

Session creation follows the control plane's resource boundary: choose or
create a versioned Agent and Environment, then create a Session that freezes
both snapshots. An optional initial `user.message` is sent as
`initial_events`, so the first turn can start as part of the creation request.
Resource selection uses one consistent dialog interaction: a live fuzzy
filter, arrow-key selection, Enter confirmation, and a final review before the
API mutation. Creating an Agent or Environment is a visible list choice rather
than a hidden shortcut.

## Projection boundary

`internal/feed` is pure. Given a Thread and its events, it creates conversation
items for messages, tools, delegations, reports, notices, and failures. It also
derives the latest aggregate `requires_action` barrier from the primary
ledger. This keeps rendering and network behavior independent.

Child actions require special care. The primary ledger contains a cross-posted
copy with a different, client-visible event ID plus `session_thread_id`. The
client responds with that visible ID. The server resolves it back to the owning
child Thread.

## Interaction boundary

Mango is organized around cloud lifecycle rather than a permanent composer:

```text
Connect  ─Enter→  Session home  ─Enter→  attached Session
  ▲                    ▲                         │
  └──── disconnect ────┘──────── Esc/detach ────┘
```

The Connect screen is currently a control-plane connection gate, not an
account login. The server contract has no production identity/device-login
endpoint yet. Likewise, the Session home refreshes the Session list explicitly
because the current API exposes SSE per Session and per Thread, not one
workspace-wide activity stream.

Inside an attached Session, wide terminals have three focus states: composer,
conversation, and Subagent workspace. The coordinator conversation and the
Agent roster remain visible together; choosing a child changes only the
transcript projected into the left viewport. The rail derives task, latest
activity, unread state, usage, and pending-action ownership from the same
Thread ledgers used by the conversation. Roster members without a Thread are
visible but non-interactive. Compact terminals collapse the rail into a status
strip and retain the searchable Agent picker.

Sending always targets the coordinator, matching the server contract. Sending
while inspecting a child first returns observation to the primary Thread, so an
optimistic preview can never appear on the wrong ledger. `Esc` returns from a
child transcript to the coordinator, then detaches back to the Session home;
interrupting work is a separate confirmed action.

The conversation is a single visual stream. User messages use an accent rail,
assistant text grows in place from SSE deltas, tools remain compact until
expanded, and action gates open a focused, input-guarded decision dialog. The
current Thread's model and token usage sit directly below the conversation.
The right workspace keeps child status, delegation task, latest meaningful
activity, usage, unread count, undelegated roster entries, and the currently
relevant pending action visible without fabricating progress percentages or
ETAs the protocol does not provide.

With no attached Session, there is no chat editor. The home screen is a durable
Session list with visible create, find, and refresh choices. Session creation
opens a dialog flow and performs the control-plane mutation only after final
review.

The UI composes Bubble Tea v2 primitives rather than maintaining terminal
input mechanics itself: `textarea` owns multiline conversation/form input,
`textinput` owns searchable pickers, `viewport` owns conversation scrolling,
and `spinner` owns bounded activity feedback. Both text components expose a
real terminal cursor so IME candidate windows follow the actual insertion
point.

Ephemeral motion is deliberately kept outside the ledger projection. Streaming
previews, the fruit-based thinking signal, and new-event sparks can redraw
freely; only final events enter `internal/feed`. Motion can be disabled. Terminal focus reporting
suppresses notifications while the user is already looking at Mango, and raw
terminal notification protocols require explicit opt-in.

At 120×30 and above, the Subagent workspace occupies 34–40 columns on the
right. Smaller terminals use a compact roster strip and keep the conversation,
activity, and editor in one column. Below 60×20 the renderer replaces the
workspace with a bounded resize prompt; it never invents a larger canvas than
the terminal.

## Demo backend

`internal/demo` is a Mango Backend implementation backed by in-memory event
ledgers. It exists for product review and UI regression, not as a parallel
protocol. Sending, interrupts, and action responses travel through the same UI
commands used by the HTTP client.
